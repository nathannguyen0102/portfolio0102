Description: 

I have presented my name on navigation bar.

My navigation bar has two links and when i click to the link, it navigates me to the related pages.

My first page is a short introduction and an image of myself, the image is also a link to the contact me section.

I have used Javascipt on my first page, when employee click on Skills and Education they can see the different display.
